BBQ Splash Page

This project was taken from Kevin Powell's course, "The Responsinve Web Design Bootcamp" on Scrimba https://scrimba.com/@kevin-powell.

An Adobe XD design file was provided and the challenge was to build a responsive "Splash page" with layout changes based on screen size. Some of the things I was able to practice were: flexbox, background images, linear-gradients, forms, buttons, media queries, etc.
